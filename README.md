# Roplot-App
This repositiory contains the code used to build the Roplot drawing machine controller smartphone and table application. This is currently a work in progress and should not be used yet.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Coming soon...

## Making Changes
The easest option for testing changes is to test in the browser. You can use the `--live-reload` flag to automatically redeploy changes as you edit. Note: This only appears to work when `--` is used.

```
cordova run -- --live-reload
```
